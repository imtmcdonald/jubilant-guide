# Contributing

This repository is maintained as a personal portfolio/showcase and is **not accepting external pull requests** at this time.

If you spot a bug or have an idea, feel free to open an issue with clear reproduction steps or a concrete proposal.

## Development guidelines (for maintainers)

- Prefer small, focused changes per PR.
- Keep each app self-contained (its own `README.md`, `.env.example`, and scripts).
- Avoid committing secrets or local data; see `docs/ai.md`.
